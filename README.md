## A Year of Travel

Trying to build the best itinerary-builder

## This is what needs to be done

~~Add hometown to form~~
* Use Cities and Airports JSON data - search it
* Create model schema
* Check package json for missing dependancies
* install mongoDB
* Require Mongoose
* Require mongo
* Add new collection to user object for destinations
* Return to the API (Or maybe do some front-end)

## This is what needs to be done
* User isn't defined as we haven't made the model schema and required it in index.js
