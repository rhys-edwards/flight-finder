## A Year of Travel

Trying to build the best itinerary-builder

## To do
* Capture city name, turn into airport IATA code on the server
* Update destination model schema
* Use Cities and Airports JSON data - search it
* Return to the API (Or maybe do some front-end)

## Completed

* ~~Work out how to use findById and where to store the id~~
* ~~Store session so the user doesn't need to log in~~
* ~~Add new collection to user object for destinations~~
* ~~Work out how to use findById and where to store the id~~
* ~~Download xcode cli tools (at home)~~
* ~~Add hometown to form~~
* ~~Add password to form~~
* ~~npm install mongoose & mongodb~~
* ~~Create model schema~~
* ~~Check package json for missing dependancies~~
* ~~Require Mongoose~~
* ~~Require mongo~~
* ~~Get Mongo up and running~~
* ~~Get data into the DB~~
* ~~Return data to the client with a test~~
* ~~Bad requests at the moment.. debug this~~
* ~~User login now works~~
* ~~Registration gets data in DB but times out~~
* ~~On registration is redirecting to index page. This should redirect as logged in user~~

## Notes
~~User isn't defined as we haven't made the model schema and required it in index.js~~
* We will still need to work out how to grab destinations and add them to the db
