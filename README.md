## A Year of Travel

Trying to build the best itinerary-builder

## To do
* Add length of trip, leaving day and month to addDestination
* Find the departure dates with the leaving day for the month
* Use length of trip to work out the return dates
* Build query
* Run through destination's IATA codes for each user and hit api for results
* Use month data to request against date range for the month
* Move airport data to external JSON file for autocomplete
* Return to the API (Or maybe do some front-end)

## Completed
* ~~Turn destination into relative IATA codes on sign up~~
* ~~Make IATA function asynchronous to return results. See StackOverflow~~
* ~~Filter through JSON to Cross-reference cities with local Airports~~
* ~~Store the location in the DB with IATA codes as subdocs~~
* ~~Use airport name to find IATA code when pushing data~~
* ~~Capture city name, turn into airport IATA code on the server~~
* ~~Update destination model schema~~
* ~~Add autocomplete to homeAirports on sign up~~
* ~~Get autocomplete to fill textField on select~~
* ~~Get the location the user wants to travel to~~
* ~~Work out how to use findById and where to store the id~~
* ~~Store session so the user doesn't need to log in~~
* ~~Add new collection to user object for destinations~~
* ~~Work out how to use findById and where to store the id~~
* ~~Download xcode cli tools (at home)~~
* ~~Add hometown to form~~
* ~~Add password to form~~
* ~~npm install mongoose & mongodb~~
* ~~Create model schema~~
* ~~Check package json for missing dependancies~~
* ~~Require Mongoose~~
* ~~Require mongo~~
* ~~Get Mongo up and running~~
* ~~Get data into the DB~~
* ~~Return data to the client with a test~~
* ~~Bad requests at the moment.. debug this~~
* ~~User login now works~~
* ~~Registration gets data in DB but times out~~
* ~~On registration is redirecting to index page. This should redirect as logged in user~~

## Notes
* ~~User isn't defined as we haven't made the model schema and required it in index.js~~
* ~~We will still need to work out how to grab destinations and add them to the db~~
