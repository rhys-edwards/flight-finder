## A Year of Travel

Trying to build the best itinerary-builder

## This is what needs to be done

~~Add hometown to form~~
~~Add password to form~~
* Download xcode cli tools (at home)
~~npm install mongoose & mongodb~~
* Use Cities and Airports JSON data - search it
~~Create model schema~~
~~Check package json for missing dependancies~~
~~Require Mongoose~~
~~Require mongo~~
* Add new collection to user object for destinations
* Return to the API (Or maybe do some front-end)
~~Get Mongo up and running~~
~~Get data into the DB~~
~~Return data to the client with a test~~
~~Bad requests at the moment.. debug this~~
* User login now works
* Registration gets data in DB but times out



## Notes
~~User isn't defined as we haven't made the model schema and required it in index.js~~
* We will still need to work out how to grab destinations and add them to the db
